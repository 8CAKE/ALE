<h2>Excretion In Humans</h2>

<h3>Excretion</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Excretion - removal of waste products of the metabolism from the body</li>
	<li>Metabolism - sum of the chemical reactions of a cell</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	
	<h4>1. How is Excretion different from egestion</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Egestion - removal of undigested food from alimentary canal through the anus. Does not come from the cells </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>2. Main Excretory Substances</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Carbon Dioxide - waste product of cellular respiration. Excreted in the air that is exhaled</li>
		<li>Water - waste product of cellular respiration in all cells and consumed through food. Excess water is excreted in urine and sweat</li>
		<li>Bile Pigments - produced by the breakdown of haemoglobin. Takes place in the liver and excreted in faeces</li>
		<li>Urea - produced in the liver from excess proteins that are consumed. It is transported in the blood to the kidneys and excreted in urine </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>3. Deamination</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>In the liver the amino group (NH<sub>2</sub>) and another Hydrogen are removed from the excess amino acid molecules to form ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>). 
		The ammonia is then combined with carbon dioxide to form urea</li>
	</ul>	
	
		
</ul>

<h3>The Urinary System</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Urinary System consists of two kidneys, two ureters, the bladder and the urethra. </li>
	<li>The renal artery and vein are associated with the urinary system</li>
	
	<h4>1. Functions of the Urinary System </h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Excretion of nitrogenous waste substances (urea, uric acid and creatine)</li>
		<li>Osmoregulation by regulating water content of bodily fluids</li>
		<li>Regulate salt content of bodily fluids</li>
		<li>Regulate pH of bodily fluids</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>2. Structure of the Urinary System  </h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Kidneys are surrounded by fat for insulation and to keep the in position </li>
		<li>Each kidney is 10cm long, 5cm wide, and 3cm thick</li>
		<li>Ureter carries urine from kidneys to the bladder</li>
		<li>A sphincter muscles control the opening of the bladder</li>
